RelKinema
==========

Relativistic two-body kinematics calculator for nuclear reaction,
including mass data manager, result list browser and plotter.




Requirements
============

RelKinema mainly depends on the following packages:

libfzcal-0.0.2
gfortran-4.6.1 or higher
kdelibs-3.5.10
qt-3.3.8




Build
=====

RelKinema uses "libkio" to handle file open dialog. You need to locate
the library on your system and let it know to the compiler.

  libfzcal is available at 

http://sourceforge.net/projects/fzcal/

Since libfzcal depends on libgfortran, -lgfortran flag is necessary
for LDFLAGS.
  The source code contains fortran code and the configure script has
no idea what to use as a fortran compiler as well as compilation
flags. The internal calculation is performed with quad-precision if
available, which is supported by gfortran version 4.6.1 and above.

Here's an example of build steps:

setenv FC /usr/local/bin/gfortran46
setenv FCFLAGS "-cpp -fcray-pointer -O2 -g0 -fdefault-integer-8"
setenv CXXFLAGS "-O2 -g0"
setenv LD_RUN_PATH /usr/local/lib/gcc46
setenv LDFLAGS "-L/usr/local/lib -L/usr/local/lib/gcc46 -lkio -lgfortran -lfzcal"
./configure --prefix=/usr/local --without-arts
gmake install




Atomic mass data
================

RelKinema depends on atomic mass data files located in a local
directory.  The current version uses mass data files extracted from a
source data file available at

http://amdc.in2p3.fr/masstables/Ame2003/mass.mas03




Note
====

* In main window, the reaction can be set when four of three nuclei
  are specified; hit enter for completion.
* massdata/A.dat contains particle masses in MeV, which includes
  photon(g), electron(e), proton(p), neutron(n) deuteron(d), triton(t)
  and alpha(a). 
* For a pure decay process, i.e. no target, you can set "g" as target.
* In plot window, hit H key to show key-bindings.
* Some configurations are saved in ~/.relkinemarc.



Notations
=========

We assume a nuclear reaction of type M2(M1,M3)M4', where
 m1:    projectile,
 m2:    target,
 m3:    ejectile,
 m4':   residual including excitation energy(M4+Ex).

(Lab. frame)
                     m3
                     /
                    /
                   /
                  / ) theta3
m1 -----------> m2 -----------------
                  \  ) theta4
                   \
                    \
                     \
                    m4+Ex

Each particle has four-momentum whose magnitude is denoted as
 
    m^2 = E^2 - p^2,

where E and p are energy and magnitude of spatial momentum,
respectively. The kinetic energy of the particle is represented as K
and the total energy of the projectile is written as,

    E = K + m.

The four-momentum in center of mass (CM) frame can be written as, for
example,

    E3' = gamma ( E3 - beta * p3 * cos(theta3)),

where gamma=1/sqrt(1-beta^2), and beta is relative speed of Lab. frame
to CM.



Parameters
==========

The on-line calculator and the custom evaluation box in the main window
accept mathematical formula with kinematic parameters, which include:

m1,m2,m3,m4;      mass,
p1,p2,p3,p4;      spatial momentum,
E1,E2,E3,E4;      total energy,
K1,K3,K4;         kinetic energy,
p1c,p2c,p3c,p4c;  spatial momentum in CM frame,
E1c,E2c,E3c,E4c;  total energy in CM frame,
K1c,K2c,K3c,K4c;  kinetic energy in CM frame,
QValue;           Q-value of the reaction,
Ex;               excitation energy of residual,
K1Min;            minimum K1,
p1Min;            minimum p1,
K1cMin;           minimum K1 in CM frame,
p1cMin;           minimum p1 in CM frame,
theM;             the invariant mass,
gamma, beta;      CM to Lab. conversion factor,
th3, th4;         theta3 and theta4
th3c, th4;        theta3 and theta4 in CM frame,
theq;             momentum transfer in 1/fm,
qMin;             minimum momentum transfer,
qMax;             maximum momentum transfer,
J3,J4;            solid angle Jacobian,
KS;               kinematic shift,
KF;               see source code.

These names are case-sensitive, and read-only.
  The results are always in MeV for energy and the angles are always
in radian. 
  In the calculator you can define new parameters such as, v3=p3/E3,
which can also be used in the custom evaluation box. Note that the
newly defined parameters are temporary, i.e., parameters in RHS are
passed by value. If defined as v3="p3/E3", v3 is a macro parameter
and will reflect changes.
