eRelKinema
==========

Relativistic two body kinematics calculator for nuclear reaction,
including mass data manager, result list browser and plotter.




Requirements
============

Reline mainly depends on the following packages:

fzcal-0.0.1
gfortran-4.6.1
kdelibs-3.5.10
qt-3.3.8




Build
=====

RelKinema uses "libkio" to handle file open dialog. You need to 
locate the library on your system and let it know to the compiler. 
  fzcal is available at 

http://sourceforge.net/projects/fzcal/

For some reason use of shared library of fzcal is not recommended.
Since libfzcal.a depends on libgfortran, -lgfortran flag is necessary
for LDFLAGS.
The source code contains fortran code and the configure script has
no idea what to use as a fortran compiler as well as compilation
flags.

Here's an example of build steps:

setenv FC /usr/local/bin/gfortran46
setenv FCFLAGS "-cpp -fcray-pointer -O2 -g0 -fdefault-integer-8"
setenv CXXFLAGS "-O2 -g0"
setenv LD_RUN_PATH /usr/local/lib/gcc46
setenv LDFLAGS "-L/usr/local/lib -L/usr/local/lib/gcc46 -lkio -lgfortran /usr/local/lib/libfzcal.a"
./configure --prefix=/usr/local --without-arts
gmake install




Atomic mass data
================

RelKinema depends on atomic mass data files located in a local directory.
The current version uses mass data files extracted from a source data
file available at http://amdc.in2p3.fr/masstables/Ame2003/mass.mas03.




Note
====
* In main window, the reaction can be set when four of three nuclei
  are specified; hit enter for completion.
* massdata/A.dat contains particle masses in MeV, which includes
  photon(g), electron(e), proton(p), neutron(n) deuteron(d), triton(t)
  and alpha(a). 
* For a pure decay process, i.e. no target, you can set "g" as target.
* In plot window, hit H key to show key-bindings.
* Some configurations are saved in ~/.relkinemarc.



Notations
=========

We assume a nuclear reaction of type M2(M1,M3)M4', where
 M1:    projectile,
 M2:    target,
 M3:    ejectile,
 M4':   residual including excitation energy(M4+Ex).

(Lab. frame)
                     M3
                     /
                    /
                   /
                  / ) theta3
M1 -----------> M2 -----------------
                  \  ) theta4
                   \
                    \
                     \
                    M4+Ex

Each particle has four-momentum whose magnitude is denoted as
 
    M^2 = E^2 - p^2

where E and p are energy and magnitude of spatial momentum,
respectively. The kinetic energy of the particle is represented as
K and the total energy of the projectile is written as,

    E = K + M.
