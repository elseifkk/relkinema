RelKinema version 0.5.6
=======================

Relativistic two-body kinematics calculator for nuclear reaction,
including atomic mass data manager, table viewer and plotter.




Requirements
============

RelKinema mainly depends on the following packages:

  libfzcal-0.0.5_1
  gfortran-4.6.1 or higher
  kdelibs-3.5.10
  qt-3.3.8

Note that it cannot build with qt4/kde4 environment or above.




Build
=====

RelKinema uses fortran codes for calculations of nuclear physics and
the configure script should know what to use as a fortran compiler.
The calculation is performed with quad-precision, which is supported
by gfortran since version 4.6, and truncated to double precision on
display. The compiler name and flags can be passed to configure script
by FC and FCFLAGS variable, respectively. For some fortran compilers
that does not support quad-precision, the following parameter might be
necessary:

  setenv FCFLAGS "-D_NO_REAL10_ -D_NO_REAL16_"

RelKinema depends on libfzcal for evaluating user-defined expressions
with kinematic parameters, available at: 

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/fzcal/

Since libfzcal depends on libgfortran, path for the library might be
necessary for LDFLAGS.

Note that for some systems, qt3/kde3 environment might work
unexpectedly if qt4/kde4 coexists. Coexistence of different versions
of gcc (gfortran) can also cause problem at run-time, to which we
suggest use of LD_RUN_PATH at linking-time as a workaround. In some
cases it is necessary to make LIBRARY_PATH include path for crti.o. 

Here's an example of build steps:

  setenv FC /usr/local/bin/gfortran
  setenv FCFLAGS "-cpp -fcray-pointer -O2 -g0 -fdefault-integer-8"
  setenv CXXFLAGS "-O2 -g0"
  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --without-arts
  gmake install




Atomic mass data
================

RelKinema depends on atomic mass data files located in a local directory.
The current version uses files extracted from a source data file available
at (as of Oct 12, 2014):

Note
====

* In main window, the reaction can be set when four of three nuclei
  are specified; hit enter for completion.
* massdata/A.dat contains particle masses in MeV, which includes
  photon(g), electron(e), proton(p), neutron(n) deuteron(d), triton(t)
  and alpha(a). 
* For a pure decay process, i.e., no target, you can set "g" as target.
* In plot window, hit H key to show key-bindings.
* Some configurations are saved in ~/.relkinemarc.

Notations
=========

We assume a nuclear reaction of type m2(m1,m3)m4', where
    m1:    projectile,
    m2:    target,
    m3:    ejectile,
    m4':   residual including excitation energy (m4+Ex).

(Lab. frame)
                     m3
                     /
                    /
                   /
                  / ) th3
m1 -----------> m2 -----------------
                  \ ) th4
                   \
                    \
                     \
                    m4+Ex

Each particle has four-momentum whose magnitude is denoted as
 
    m^2 = E^2 - p^2,

where E and p are energy and magnitude of spatial momentum,
respectively. The kinetic energy of the particle is represented as K
and the total energy of the projectile is written as,

    E = K + m.

The four-momentum in center of mass (CM) frame can be written as, for
example,

    E3c = gamma * ( E3 - beta * p3 * cos(th3)),

where gamma=1/sqrt(1-beta^2), and beta is relative speed of Lab. frame
to CM.




Parameters
==========

The on-line calculator and the custom evaluation box in the main window
accept mathematical expressions with kinematic parameters, which include:

m1,m2,m3,m4;      mass,
p1,p2,p3,p4;      spatial momentum,
E1,E2,E3,E4;      total energy,
K1,K3,K4;         kinetic energy,
p1c,p2c,p3c,p4c;  spatial momentum in CM frame,
E1c,E2c,E3c,E4c;  total energy in CM frame,
K1c,K2c,K3c,K4c;  kinetic energy in CM frame,
QValue;           Q-value of the reaction,
Ex;               excitation energy of residual,
K1Min;            minimum K1,
p1Min;            minimum p1,
K1cMin;           minimum K1 in CM frame,
p1cMin;           minimum p1 in CM frame,
theM;             the invariant mass,
gamma, beta;      CM to Lab. conversion factor,
th3, th4;         theta3 and theta4,
th3Max,th4Max;    maximum theta3 and theta4,
th3c, th4c;       theta3 and theta4 in CM frame,
q;                momentum transfer in 1/fm,
qMin;             minimum momentum transfer,
qMax;             maximum momentum transfer,
J3,J4;            solid angle Jacobian,
KS;               kinematic shift (dK3/dth3), 
KF;               kinematic factor (dp3/dth3/p3).

These parameters are case-sensitive and read-only, and passed by
reference to libfzcal in quad-precision, if possible.

The results are always in MeV for energy and the angles in radian. 

In the calculator you can define new parameters such as, 

  v3=p3/E3

which can also be used in the custom evaluation box. Note that the
newly defined parameters are temporary, i.e., parameters in RHS are
passed by value, however, if defined as 

  v3="p3/E3"

v3 becomes a macro parameter and will reflect changes in p3 and E3
(parameters in RHS will be passed by reference).
