* child windows now inherit the font of the main window.
* FIX: KS dose not reflect the energy unit change.
* the main window design changed to allow resizing.
* FIX: rkCalc UI fails to add history.
* FIX: rclist.ui fails to show scrollbar.
* FIX?: rkcore contains many inadequate codes esp. for elastic reactions.

	it is defined in rkcore and accessible by rkcalc as "th4Max".
* BUG?: when doubleNumFormat is "%.16g" or such like thetaLAB is printed as
	6.100000000000001 for d=0.1.

v0.5.5

* FIX: main loop crashes when table window is closed.
* FIX: deg/rad button does not work when scrtype=q
* FIX: zero incident energy not accepted even if QValue is positive.
* FIX: setting major ticks division fails for larger values.
* FIX?: setting number of major ticks sometimes fails.
* FIX: KShift does not become 0 for th3=pi because sin(pi)/=0 in rkcore.f90
* mass data manager now wont automatically load the newly created mass data as default and
  "Set as Default" button was added.
* mbox now uses QTextEdit to show message.
* M-key to toggle maximize/unmaximize plot window and result window.
* Right-Button drag zooms in/out in plot window.

  -fno-exception flag.  this line was appended to configure.in.in:
  CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS $USE_EXCEPTIONS"
* FIX: mdm sets particle masses to zero if invoked with no mass
  data directory given.
* FIX: geometry of message label changed in mdm.
* FIX: table&plot button remains disabled and rkc and fzc left
  uninitialized when the table closed before calculation is
  finished.
* adapted to libfzcal v0.0.4, which is only a bugfix release with
  some updates in C interface.
* mdm now emits updateMass signal when the contents of mass data
  file are updated and the main performs reload the mass data and
  recalculation of the reaction.
