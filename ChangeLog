v0.5.4
* FIX: failed to open mass data manager with the message:
  "RelKinemaDlg::mdmSlot(): Not implemented yet".
* FIX: with newer gcc kinemaplotcls.h wont compile because of
  -fno-exception flag.  this line was appended to configure.in.in:
  CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS $USE_EXCEPTIONS"
* FIX: mdm sets particle masses to zero if invoked with no mass
  data directory given.
* FIX: geometry of message label changed in mdm.
* FIX: table&plot button remains disabled and rkc and fzc left
  uninitialized when the table closed before calculation is
  finished.
* adapted to libfzcal v0.0.4, which is only a bugfix release with
  some updates in C interface.
* mdm now emits updateMass signal when the contents of mass data
  file are updated and the main performs reload the mass data and
  recalculation of the reaction.
* new-kb: 1,2,3 to show page of the Emission box.
